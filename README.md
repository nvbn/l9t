# L9T

Reusable typesafe kubernetes configurations with fast development cycle and no yaml.

*One step ahead from K8S*

## Why?

Because working with kuberentes configs and helm is painful:

* YAML/JSON without proper valdiation is error prone.
* Go templates are ugly and too limited.
* Subcharts are paing to manage.

## How?

TypeScript + Deno + just kubectl.

## Goals

❌ Types for Kubernetes APIs.

❌ Hot reloading.

❌ Helm charts-like reusable configration packages.
